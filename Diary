Week 1:
Did a Python Tutorial on code Academy 
choose PY-Charm IDE off a recommendation from a friend 
checked out as an example of mainfold embedding- http://vecg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/Projects/projects_fonts/projects_fonts.html

Week 2:
Began work on a python Font grabber to download fonts from http://www.1001fonts.com
hit with bad cold no work done for the week

Week 3: 
Still getting over cold 
met with Barak on Thursday he recommended i use the google fonts library
i dont think font grabber is needed anymore git git cloned entire font library from there git hub
@ https://github.com/google/fonts

Week4: 
playing catch up on assignments Thursday 12/10/17 began trying to build a manifold

Week5:
out for personal reasons

Week6-7:
	
work delayed to personal reasons

week 8:
i sat down on Wednesday morning determined to have a working version by Christmas after some experimenting in the morning i have settled to use Tkinter as my widget library. i wrote a small shell script to go through the fonts-master file from that i pulled from the google fonts library and extract and place every TTF file in a separate folder(see fontOrganiser.sh). with all my files in a convenient to access location i began work on the application i have resolved to use PIL(from the supported Pillow fork of the original PIL).

the reason ill be using PIL is simple as tkinter does not recognise unsupported fonts that are not directly in the machines local font library so instead of devising a piece of software to implement all fonts into the local library i can instead create an image use the google font files and imbed the image as a label within Tkinter.

Then as we cycle through the fonts we can simply replace the image instead of generating an image for each font file

as of Friday Evening the App is working fully but for one small flaw witch i hope to fix by Monday Evening.

Week 9:
Monday: the application is working bare bones on python (UI will require some work now i just need to implement the machine learning)
