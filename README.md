Final Year Project
Manifold Embedding Font Chooser

## How To use

* the shell script can be ran to create the fonts folder however the fonts folder here should be used and dont bother running the shell script i removed a few fonts from the fonts folder manually

* run data_sets to create a folder containing all the font test data you need based off what ever fonts are in the the "fonts" folder place what ever ttf files into "fonts" you wish to use

* after creating your data_set run the manifold it will take about an hour and 30 mins for 2300 fonts at the current size setting

* once the manifolds have been embed fire up the UI 

* a startup file is in the works to avoid the hassle
